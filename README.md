# Real-Instruments
Overhauling and adding realistic sounding instruments to the game Starbound.

(If you're here from the wiki / forum where this is linked to, the following I pretty much copy/paste from there)


## What is it?
This is a massive overhaul of the instruments of the game.
It uses real samples, with most of them being in minor thirds, throughout the full real range of each instrument.
None of the default full range from a1 to a7, unless the instrument does that.	
This was accomplished by having a clip of pure silence and setting any note that is not in that instruments range to silence. 
The soft and upright pianos are fully sampled throughout their entire range.

## Samples?
All samples are gathered from open source or public domain sample libraries,
such as the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra, VSCO Community Edition and the Virtual Playing Orchestra.
Most of the samples have been edited to have reverb and sound more realistic, and "proper".
See the Credits & Attribution at the bottom for links to them.
	
# Note:
Currently, this is only useful in Starbound Composer, as I do not have the instruments in the game world yet.
They can easily be identified with the preceding text of "RI - ", for Real Instruments.
Though, the instruments are accessible through the "/spawnitem" command. A full list of the ids is in "items.txt" in the mod download.

#### Known Issues:
  - The upright piano does sound somewhat muted (to me, anyways) This is why there will be many pianos.
	
#### Demos: 
Despite having a large MIDI collection, only a few of them work well with Composer, as the rest are instrument heavy.
