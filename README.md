# Real-Instruments
Overhauling and adding realistic sounding instruments to the game Starbound.

(If you're here from the wiki where this is linked to, the following i pretty much copy/paste from there)


What is it?
	This is a massive overhaul of the instruments of the game.
	It uses real samples, with most of them being in minor thirds, throughout the full real range of each instrument.
	None of the default full range from a1 to a7, unless the instrument does that.
	
	This was accomplished by having a clip of pure silence and setting any note that is not in that instruments range to silence. 
	The soft and upright pianos are fully sampled throughout their entire range.
	All samples are gathered from open source or public domain sample libraries.
	
	Such as the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra, VSCO Community Edition and the Virtual Playing Orchestra.
	Most of the samples have been edited to have reverb and sound more realistic, and "proper".
	The upright piano is from Besku Upright, which can be found on freesound.org by searching user 'beskhu'.
	
	Currently, this is only useful in Starbound Composer, as I do not have the instruments in the game world yet.
	They can easily be identified with the preceding text of "RI - ", for Real Instruments.

Here's a list of the current instruments:
	In the string section we have:
		Solo Violin
		Solo Cello
		First Violin Section

	Electric Bass
	"Chunky" Electric Bass
	Clean Electric Guitar

	Overdrive Guitar
	Distorted Guitar 
	(Yes, 4 different electric guitars. Might be the same one with different amp settings. Might even sample my own and throw it in)
	Vibrophone
	Timpani
	Xylophone
	Marimba
	Soft Electric Piano
	Electric Piano
	'Hard' Piano.
	Honky-Tonk Piano

	Electric Grand Piano
	Soft Piano
	(Yes. A lot of pianos)
	Harp
	Pizzicato Strings
	Tremolo Strings
	Choir
	Soprano Sax
	Alto Sax
	Tenor Sax
	Baritone Sax
	Various drumkits, for different tyes of sound. 
	Maybe a few extra bonuses sampled by me from an old Yamaha keyboard I have lying around(PSR-75, for the curious). 
	
Known Issues:
	The uprght piano does sound somewhat muted (to me, anyways) This is why there will be many pianos.
	
Demos: (Despite having a large MIDI collection, only a few of them work well with Composer, as the rest are instrument heavy.)

 Basically, if you make changes to it let me know, and if they're good enough, they might just make it into the releases (with credit, of course).
